Ruby on Rails Developer
-----------------------

Rapid River manages a mission-critical web analytics data warehouse for one of our clients. This data warehouse has been in production for a year but still receives regular updates in the form of new data sources, reports, and bug fixes. In addition, this team responds to requests for ad-hoc reports, data sanity checking, and system debugging as needed. We are looking add a mid-level Ruby on Rails developer to this team.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- Front-end web development. Experience with React and related tools would be a plus.
- Relational database analysis and design, in particular with PostgreSQL.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).
