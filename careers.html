Ruby on Rails Developer
-----------------------

We are looking for Ruby on Rails developers ranging from smart junior engineers to Rails Core contributors and everywhere in between. We currently support several different clients' Rails applications and we are always adding new clients. Our workflow will allow you to work on meaningful apps with new technologies and large, active user bases.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- CSS and Javascript swizzling. React, backbone.js, Angular are all a big plus.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

### Nice to have:

- Experience upgrading Rails from v2.3 to modern versions.
- Real-life experience with Elasticsearch.
- Relational database analysis and design.
- AWS (especially experience with EC2-hosted operations).

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).

JavaScript Web Developer
------------------------

We are looking for JavaScript Web developers to join a couple of Rapid River’s development teams.

### Essential skills and requirements:

- Experience with JavaScript front-end frameworks, in particular with React/Redux. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with JavaScript apps and npm packages to which you’ve contributed substantially.
- CSS swizzling. Ideally you have an instinctive understanding of how specific browsers react to different styling approaches; a sense that has grown with you over the years as you mastered front-end web development. You also like to lean on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap because who likes to write UI components from the ground up?
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We’re not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)

### Candidates with these additional skills will be strongly preferred:

- Ruby on Rails development skills. We are primarily a RoR shop it’s highly likely that backends that you’ll interact with will be built with it.
- A sense for UX / user flow design. We often convey ideas about user flow designs through mockups. Being able to contribute to such discussions in a meaningful way would be highly valuable to us.
- Experience with building web apps for search and/or reporting purposes.
- A well-considered opinion on how to extend web applications into the mobile space, accompanied with relevant experience.

### We'd be delighted if you also had experience with:

- Elasticsearch.
- AWS (especially experience with EC2-hosted operations and OpsWorks).

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).

Quality Assurance Intern
------------------------

We are looking for an intern to help us with our quality assurance efforts across multiple projects.

This is an excellent opportunity to learn how software and web sites are created and maintained in the "real world", by helping us to support a wide range of web-based products used by tens of thousands of users every day. As such, this position is ideal for anyone pursuing studies related to computer science, web design or product management.

### Essential skills and requirements:

- You must be very comfortable as a web "power user". This should lots of experience with apps like Google Docs (word processing and sheets), knowing how to research questions online using search engines, and having some sense about the similarities and differences between various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, Opera, etc.)
- You must be extremely self-directed. We will give you tasks such as "go find out how to reproduce this bug" or "tell us which browsers behave this way" and we expect you to get the answer or tell us exactly where you are stuck so that we can help you.
- You must show a deep sense of pride in the quality of your work. Often you will be the last barrier between software that we write (or data that we publish) and the world. You must be comfortable with the idea that [the buck stops here](https://www.trumanlibrary.org/buckstop.htm) when it comes to the perceptions of our customers and, more importantly, our customers' users.
- You must have excellent communication skills in English, both in speaking and in writing.
- A flexible schedule that can accommodate our customers' release plans.

### Candidates with these additional skills will be strongly preferred:

- HTML and/or Javascript coding
- OS X or Unix command-line tools

### We'd be delighted if you also had experience with:

- University-level music, design, computer science, physical science, or mathematics
- Hosted site tools (Hubspot, Drupal, etc.)
- Mobile app development
