We are currently hiring for three distinct positions:

- [Engineering Team Lead](#engineering-team-lead).
- [Ruby on Rails Developer](#ruby-on-rails-developer).
- [JavaScript Web Developer](#javascript-web-developer).

Although all positions are based in Malaysia, we are big proponents of remote work and would expect you to work in our office as needed/desired, not 100% of the time.

Engineering Team Lead
---------------------

To support our growth, we are looking to bring on-board key senior level, managerial/technical people.

This role is to be the primary contact person for one of our clients, and to manage the Rapid River tech team that is implementing their project.

### Responsibilities include:

- Liaising with one of our clients; managing whichever aspects of the project they happen to need help with.
- Formulating high-level technical project road-maps and ensuring they get delivered.
- Coaching technical team members: performing code review, mentorship-style pair programming, etc.
- Triaging system problems and customer feedback.
- Writing code.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Proven technical project management experience.
- Excellent English language written and verbal communication skills.
- Good temperament and a genuine enjoyment of helping other people grow.
- Relevant technical experience with some or all of the following: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, front-end web development, Unix (esp. Linux variants), AWS, PostgreSQL.

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).

Ruby on Rails Developer
-----------------------

We are looking for Ruby on Rails developers ranging from smart junior engineers to Rails Core contributors and everywhere in between. We currently support several different clients' Rails applications and we are always adding new clients. Our workflow will allow you to work on meaningful apps with new technologies and large, active user bases.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- CSS and Javascript swizzling. React, backbone.js, Angular are all a big plus.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

### Nice to have:

- Experience upgrading Rails from v2.3 to modern versions.
- Real-life experience with Elasticsearch.
- Relational database analysis and design.
- AWS (especially experience with EC2-hosted operations).

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).

JavaScript Web Developer
------------------------

We are looking for JavaScript Web developers to join a couple of Rapid River’s development teams.

### Essential skills and requirements:

- Experience with JavaScript front-end frameworks, in particular with React/Redux. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with JavaScript apps and npm packages to which you’ve contributed substantially.
- CSS swizzling. Ideally you have an instinctive understanding of how specific browsers react to different styling approaches; a sense that has grown with you over the years as you mastered front-end web development. You also like to lean on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap because who likes to write UI components from the ground up?
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We’re not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)

### Candidates with these additional skills will be strongly preferred:

- Ruby on Rails development skills. We are primarily a RoR shop it’s highly likely that backends that you’ll interact with will be built with it.
- A sense for UX / user flow design. We often convey ideas about user flow designs through mockups. Being able to contribute to such discussions in a meaningful way would be highly valuable to us.
- Experience with building web apps for search and/or reporting purposes.
- A well-considered opinion on how to extend web applications into the mobile space, accompanied with relevant experience.

### We'd be delighted if you also had experience with:

- Elasticsearch.
- AWS (especially experience with EC2-hosted operations and OpsWorks).

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).
