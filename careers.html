We are currently hiring for the following positions:

- [Ruby on Rails Developer](#ruby-on-rails-developer)
<!--- [JavaScript Developer](#javascript-developer)-->
- [HR and Admin Executive](#hr-and-admin-executive)

Although all positions are based in Malaysia, we are big proponents of remote work and would expect you to work in our office as needed/desired, not 100% of the time.

Ruby on Rails Developer
-----------------------

We are looking for Ruby on Rails developers ranging from smart junior engineers to Rails Core contributors and everywhere in between. We currently support several different clients' Rails applications and we are always adding new clients. Our workflow will allow you to work on meaningful apps with new technologies and large, active user bases.

### Skills and Requirements

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- CSS and Javascript swizzling. React, backbone.js, Angular are all a big plus.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

Nice to have:

- Experience upgrading Rails from v2.3 to modern versions.
- Real-life experience with Elasticsearch.
- Relational database analysis and design.
- AWS (especially experience with EC2-hosted operations).
