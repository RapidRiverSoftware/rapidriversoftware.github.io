Ruby on Rails Developer
-----------------------

Rapid River provides Ruby on Rails development for several projects for a large client. These projects range from web-analytics data warehouse population, to web application development on a calendar scheduling product, to infrastructure and product development on microservices-based sites in the legal space. All such products are high traffic (millions of page views per month) and our contributions are mission-critical and high-impact.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- Relational database analysis and design, in particular with PostgreSQL.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

### Nice-to-Haves:

- Strong front-end web development skills. Experience with React and related tools would be a plus, or a solid general understanding of JavaScript for web application development.
- Experience in other (non-Ruby) backend programming languages. Elixir, Rust, Python, Scala (to name a few) appear in the stacks we contribute to, so experience in these would allow you to be more effective in your role.

### Benefits

- Remote-first culture: flexible working hours, near-total freedom to manage your own schedule.
- Space in our Bangsar South office for use if working from home doesn't appeal to you.
  - Parking and lunch provided if you do!
- Competitive salary.
- Medical insurance and dental/optical allowance.
- Laptop (Macbook Pro) will be supplied for carrying out work duties.

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).
