- Remove impediments for the team, and ensure focus on value delivery and improvement.
- Manage cross-team dependencies for larger projects that span teams and business units.
- Contribute to and drive team prioritization discussions.
- Provide feedback to and partner with the dev and product managers to help improve team performance.

### Skills and Requirements:

- 5+ years IT project management experience.

- Strong written and oral communication skills.
- Strong attention to detail, follow-through, and organizational skills.
- Highly analytical, logical, and good problem solving skills.
- Excellent interpersonal skills, ability to work with diverse personality types.
- Ability to interact professionally with all levels of staff.

### Benefits

- Experience in other (non-Ruby) backend programming languages. Elixir, Rust, Python, Scala (to name a few) appear in the stacks we contribute to, so experience in these would allow you to be more effective in your role.

### Benefits

- Remote-first culture: flexible working hours, near-total freedom to manage your own schedule.
- Space in our Bangsar South office for use if working from home doesn't appeal to you.
