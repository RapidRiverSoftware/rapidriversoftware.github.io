KL-Based Rails Developer for US-Based Projects
----------------------------------------------

We are looking for Rails developers ranging from smart junior devs to Rails Core contributors and everywhere in between. We currently support several different clients' Rails applications and we are always adding new clients. Our workflow will allow you to work on meaningful apps with new technologies and large, active user bases.

Although the position is based in Malaysia, we are big proponents of remote work and would expect you to work in our office as needed/desired, not 100% of the time.

### Skills &amp; Requirements

Required:

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- CSS and Javascript swizzling. React, backbone.js, Angular are all a big plus.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

Nice to have:

- Real-life experience with Elasticsearch.
- Relational database analysis and design.
- AWS (especially experience with EC2-hosted operations).

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).
