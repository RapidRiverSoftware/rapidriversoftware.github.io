Ruby on Rails Developer
-----------------------

Rapid River provides Ruby on Rails development for several projects for a large client. These projects range from web-analytics data warehouse population, to web application development on a calendar scheduling product, to infrastructure and product development on microservices-based sites in the legal space. All such products are high traffic (millions of page views per month) and our contributions are mission-critical and high-impact.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- Relational database analysis and design, in particular with PostgreSQL.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

### Nice-to-Haves:

- Strong front-end web development skills. Experience with React and related tools would be a plus, or a solid general understanding of JavaScript for web application development.
- Experience in other (non-Ruby) backend programming languages. Elixir, Rust, Python, Scala (to name a few) appear in the stacks we contribute to, so experience in these would allow you to be more effective in your role.

If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us by sending an email to [workwithus@rrsoft.co](mailto:workwithus@rrsoft.co).
