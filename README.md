## 🎨 Basic Style Guide
### CSS naming
- SCSS/CSS filenames should be kebab case (i.e. `kebab-case`) to match class names.
- Assume that each parent "component" should have it's own corresponding stylesheet. E.g. The `.about-page` class declaration can be found in the `_about-page.scss` file
- A parent "component" will be named with two words, separated by a hyphen. E.g. `.service-list`
- A child "component" will be named with one "word", no hyphens. E.g. `.serviceitem`
- Some out-dated classes probably exist that don't follow this convention, so those should be refactored.

### JS naming
JavaScript filenames should be camel case (i.e. `camelCase`) to match the JS object/method naming conventions.

### HTML/Jekyll Template naming
HTML/Jekyll templates should be snake case (i.e. `snake_case`) to match Jekyll/Ruby conventions.

### Syntax highlighting for your code
In your markdown, you can use a shortcode to add syntax highlighting to your code. Below is an example for JavaScript:

{%highlight javascript %}
  function myCoolFunc() {
    let hello = "uh, hello";
    alert(hello);
  }

  myCoolFunc();
{% endhighlight %}
```
