<div class="problem">
<h2 class="subheading">The Problem</h2>
<p>
EssayJack came to us with a MVP. Their app was supporting a small user base, but it had a number of concerning problems. They were keen to understand why these problems were present. They wanted to make judgement calls on how next to proceed with product development. They were also keen to find a consulting partner to take ownership of the technical development of the product.

<h2 class="subheading">Our Solution</h2>
<p>
We took a detailed look at the app’s codebase, deployment and technical processes. We documented the things that were done well. We listed out where the app could be improved, and why the concerning problems highlighted to us were present and how to fix them. We compiled all this information in a PDF report, written for an executive audience.

The audit shed light on the root cause of many of the app’s problems. It created a backlog of technical debt repayment necessary to prepare EJ for future growth. This lead to Rapid River going on to completing many items from this backlog. EssayJack become stable, was able to support an increase in new user activity, and provided the groundwork for EssayJack’s eventual rebuild.
