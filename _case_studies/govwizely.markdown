<div class="problem">
<h2 class="subheading">The Problem</h2>
<p>
<a class="link-pink" href="http://www.govwizely.com/" target="_blank">GovWizely</a> were tasked with making many data sets publicly accessible via standardised HTTP APIs. These data sets were stored in places and formats which were difficult to access and decipher.
</p>
</div>

<div class="solution">
<h2 class="subheading">Our Solution</h2>
<p>
Our team build a web application which read a data source, transferred the data into an accessible format, populated this data into Elasticsearch indexes, then made the information available online via HTTP APIs.
</p>

<div class="value">
<h2 class="subheading">Proven Results / Value Add</h2>
<p>
Many data sets containing useful personal and business information became accessible to the public. GovWizely was able to deliver on their commitment to provide this service.
