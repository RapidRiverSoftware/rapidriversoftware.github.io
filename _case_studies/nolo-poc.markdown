<div class="problem">
<h2 class="subheading">The Problem</h2>
<p>
Tasked with re-building an existing product, and having chosen open-source tools to provide parts of the new implementation, we found ourselves in an interesting situation. We wanted a prototype to verify that our chosen tooling would indeed work within the bigger picture of the entire product. We also wanted to demonstrate certain user journeys using our chosen tools. It wasn’t clear that a UX prototype built with a tool like Figma would convey this adequately.

<div class="solution">
<h2 class="subheading">Our Solution</h2>
<p>
We built a proof-of-concept of the product with code. We kept the scope as focused as possible. Rather than build out a backend, we mocked application data in order to support the journeys we wished to demonstrate. When complete, one key and non-trivial user journey using the tooling we had chosen was demonstrable.

<h2 class="subheading">Proven Results / Value Add</h2>
<p>
Prototyping with code is risky as it can be time-consuming. But with our focused scope and use of mocking, our two-person team built the proof-of-concept in less than a month. All stakeholders experienced an “aha” moment in which they saw how the tools we’d chosen would work in the new product. But further, stakeholders could actually use the proof-of-concept themselves. Because we had deployed it to a staging environment, they could play with the implementation and become comfortable with it. This gave everyone confidence in our direction, and allowed us to proceed to continued product development.
