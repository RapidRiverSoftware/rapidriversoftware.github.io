1. Initial Requirements Gathering
  * We’ll work with you to compile information about what it is you’re aiming to build.
2. Design Prototype
  * We’ll partner with an experienced design firm to carry out a Design Sprint. This week-long process will result in a design prototype of your product being built.
3. MVP Implementation
  * We assemble a Scrum team and iterate towards an MVP. The end goal of this phase is to have real customers pay for the product. We’ll bring in suitable partners to build aspects of the product that we won’t build ourselves, for example native mobile applications.
4. General Availability & Beyond
  * We continue fleshing out the product, helping you grow your user base and hit your growth targets.
