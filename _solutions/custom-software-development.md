1. Rapid Ramp-Up
  * We’ll get ourselves on-boarded onto your team and ready to complete work quickly.
2. Process Alignment
  * Whether fitting into your established workflow or bringing our own, we’ll fit in and work side by side with your people in a complementary fashion.
3. Working Alongside In Situ Software
  * We'll take a deeper dive into discovering your existing stack. We’ll learn about and figure out how to plan, build and deploy services which will co-exist with existing components in your system.
4. Internal Projects or Team Collaboration
  * We can take ownership of a particular development area within your architecture, or we can join forces with one of your existing teams.
