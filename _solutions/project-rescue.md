1. Code Audit
  * We’ll deep dive into your codebase and technical processes, identify what is working and what isn’t, then recommend a suitable course of action.
2. Optimization and Support
  * We’ll provide immediate support for your application, even if our recommendation is to significantly rework things. Your business still needs to function in the short term after all.
3. Technical Debt Repayment
  * Whether we have agreed to carry out some refactoring of the existing application, re-architect larger pieces of it or perform a complete rebuild - this is when we get busy implementing this work.
4. Custom Software Development
  * With the project back on track, we can transition into providing more typical product development for your application.
5. In-House Team
  * Eventually you may prefer to staff your technical team yourself. We can help you do that, and help hand off associated responsibilities too.
