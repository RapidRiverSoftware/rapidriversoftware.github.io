From development to production, we prefer to use container-based solutions like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Weâ€™ve deployed many orchestrations using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) on platforms such as GCP and AWS. We make our apps observable and monitor them with tools such as [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
