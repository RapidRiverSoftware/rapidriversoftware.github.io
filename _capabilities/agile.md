We are passionate proponents of [Agile](https://blog.capterra.com/definition-of-agile-project-management/) software development. Our teams typically practice either [Scrum](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/agile-needs-to-be-both-iterative-and-incremental) or [Kanban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5izyN66PTxs). We can help you adopt an Agile approach on your team or in your company.
