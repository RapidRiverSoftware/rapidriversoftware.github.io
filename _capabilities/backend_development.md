Our overarching strength is [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). We also like to use PHP [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) when circumstances are appropriate. We complement our web framework choices with open-source technologies like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/).
