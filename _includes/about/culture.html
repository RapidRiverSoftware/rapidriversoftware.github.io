        <h3 class="description">
            The traditional practice of having to work from an office is
            highly restrictive to modern lifestyles. Rapid River founders wanted to build a company with fewer
            limitations, so they embraced the concept of remote-first, distributed teams. We are built, from the
            ground up, without the constraints of location. This value flows through everything we do.
