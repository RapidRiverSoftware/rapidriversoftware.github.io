We have an opening on one of our development teams for the position of Lead Rails Developer.

### About the Role

You will lead a small team of developers who deliver product increments in an Agile setting. You will ensure that the technical aspects of tasks are planned and implemented correctly and to a high level of quality. You'll do this through planning sessions, pair programming, code review and the use of code quality metrics. You will mentor junior team members and ensure that they're turning into stronger and more experienced software developers. You'll be the primary contact point for the development team, liaising with the team's Project Manager and Product Owner where necessary. You'll ensure that major new development initiatives (including an upcoming re-build of the application's JS frontend) get off the ground and reach completion. In short, you'll be responsible for the team's success in delivering quality software.

### About the Product

The product is a web application which provides appointment scheduling services to SMEs. The product is used by many thousands of businesses daily. The application has a single-page JavaScript frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend.

### About You

Above all else, you're a developer. You love code and coding. You'd prefer to talk about the nuances and trade-offs of implementation approaches over other topics. You're dabbling in the cutting-edge, and debating with other attendees at community meet-ups. You take pride in providing a quality solution, whether it be in coding style, test coverage, or correctness of the product. You like to get to know about peripheral disciplines which help you achieve this quality, like QA, Project/Product Management, UI/UX Design, DevOps Engineering. You gain satisfaction from helping others around you, from junior developers who see you as a role model, to other people in the organization who see you as a source of help and the solver of problems. You don't mind to speak out when the correct path forward isn't being followed, but are open to listening to others' points of view, in case they may change your mind. You like pushing projects forward, and are always on the look-out for creative ways to help you to do so.
