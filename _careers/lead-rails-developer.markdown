Rapid River develops a web application which provides appointment scheduling services to SMEs. The product is used by many thousands of businesses daily. The application has a single-page JavaScript frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. We're looking for a person to provide technical leadership for this project; to plan and architect major new feature initiatives, to guide and mentor technical team members, to liaise with the project's product and project managers, and even to write some code from time to time :-)

A major part of the scope of work after on-boarding will be to lead an overhaul of the application's frontend. This will include selecting a JavaScript stack to build upon, and building out a mobile-first user experience.

### Responsibilities:

- Formulating high-level technical project roadmaps and ensuring they get delivered.
- Coaching technical team members: performing code review, mentorship-style pair programming, etc.
- Liaising with the project's product and project managers, and other stakeholders.
- Triaging system problems and customer feedback.
- Writing code: primarily Ruby on Rails and front-end JavaScript.

### Skills and Requirements:

- At least five years of web application development experience, three or more of which with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.
- Excellent English language written and verbal communication skills.
- Good temperament and a genuine enjoyment of helping others grow.
- Relevant technical experience with some or all of the following: Ruby on Rails, front-end web development with JavaScript, Unix (esp. Linux variants), PostgreSQL, Redis.
