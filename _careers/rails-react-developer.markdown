Rapid River provides ongoing development of a web application written in Ruby on Rails and React. The application is in the Education space, and provides a product to students of institutions in North America and Asia Pacific.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Experience with Rails: the more, the better. Ideally your GitHub profile will be littered with Rails apps and gems to which you've contributed substantially.
- Strong front-end web development skills, in particular with React and related tools like Redux.
- Testing frameworks like Cypress, Jest and RSpec.
- Relational database analysis and design, in particular with MySQL.
- Hosted Kubernetes solutions, e.g. Google Cloud Platform.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
