Rapid River manages several mission-critical data analysis systems for one of our clients. These systems include a web analytics data warehouse, a generic clickstream ingestion pipeline, and a suite of tools used for business intelligence analysis.

This position is for a software developer whose responsibility will be to prepare infrastructure which makes large data sets accessible to Data Science teams for further analysis. ETL-ing data into data warehouses for specific analysis will also be required, as will involvement in downstream business intelligence and Machine Learning development in some situations.

### Skills and Requirements:

- Working knowledge of streaming platforms like Apache Kafka.
- Analytics Engines like Apache Spark and the programming languages used along with them, e.g. Scala.
- The Hadoop ecosystem.
- Relational database analysis and design, in particular with PostgreSQL.
- Excellent communication skills. (Seriously! We're not just saying that. We work with a lot of remote clients and developers, so being able to speak and write clearly is absolutely critical.)
- Unix, esp. Linux variants.

This is a senior-level position, and so we are looking for candidates with at least five years of relevant experience.

### Nice-to-Haves:

- Experience with Ruby on Rails.
- Experience with Machine Learning technologies, like Tensorflow.
- Experience with Cassandra, or other specific-purpose database solutions.
