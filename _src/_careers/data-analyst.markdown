### About the Role

This role involves extracting value from clickstream data from a wide range of websites and apps. It involves understanding user activity and figuring out the extent to which we can track users accurately and reliably. Making the data we collect more extensive, and transforming it so that it is more useful to Data Scientists will be an ongoing function.

### About the Product

Rapid River manages several mission-critical data analysis systems for one of our clients.

One of these systems is a generic clickstream ingestion pipeline, which feeds around 1000 events per second into a Hadoop ecosystem for further analysis by our client’s Data Science team. The data collected represents user activity over a few hundred websites, all owned by our client. The project’s purpose is to use this information to drive effective marketing, and in general to better understand their users.

Other systems we manage collect similar user information, but do so for single business units. We help by providing suites of tools used for business intelligence analysis, used to generate reports which feed back into our clients’ sales tools.
