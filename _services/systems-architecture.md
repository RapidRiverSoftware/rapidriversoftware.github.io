We have years of experience designing, upgrading and migrating complex systems in environments ranging from startups to large corporations to government.

Our general approach is to understand what your pain-points are, then take them off your hands and deal with them. The types of projects we can help you with include:

* Designing system architectures appropriate for your business and product.
* Upgrading specific technologies in your stack, so that you have up-to-date features and the latest security patches.
* Simplifying and refactoring aspects of your infrastructure which may have grown overly complex.
* Migrating bespoke internal tools to off-the-shelf 3rd-party products.
* Refining business processes (and the technologies which enable them) to make your non-technical teams more effective.
